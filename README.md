| `)`, `]`, `}`           | **Cursor Skip:** If the line already has the correct closing character at the cursor position, it skips over it instead of inserting a duplicate. |
| `Backspace`             | **Auto-Delete Pair:** If the cursor is positioned between a matching pair, it deletes both characters.                                            |
